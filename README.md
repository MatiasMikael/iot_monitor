## iot_monitor

### Overview
This project demonstrates an IoT data pipeline for generating, streaming, and storing simulated sensor data. The pipeline uses Kafka for data streaming and MongoDB for data storage.

### Tools Used
- Python for scripting and automation
- Faker library for generating fake IoT data
- Apache Kafka for data streaming
- MongoDB for storing the processed data

### Workflow
Step 1 Generate simulated IoT data using the Faker library  
Step 2 Stream the generated data to a Kafka topic  
Step 3 Consume the streamed data from Kafka and store it in MongoDB  

### Logs
All logs generated during the execution of this project are stored in the folder named 5_logs

### Documentation
A visual representation of the stored data in MongoDB is available in the folder named 4_docs
